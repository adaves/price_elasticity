# Notebook Debugging Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Environment Issues
1. **Platform mismatch**: Notebooks were designed for Windows with Access database
2. **Missing data files**: No raw data files existed in data/raw/
3. **Path issues**: Hardcoded Windows paths that don't work in Linux
4. **Import path issues**: Incorrect relative paths for importing custom modules

### Data Issues
1. **Missing raw data**: `data/raw/iri_sales_data.parquet` didn't exist
2. **Missing cleaned data**: `data/processed/iri_sales_data_clean.parquet` didn't exist
3. **Missing directories**: `data/raw/` and `data/sample/` directories were missing

### Specific Notebook Issues

#### 01_data_loading.ipynb
- **Issue**: Trying to connect to Windows Access database at `C:\Users\adaves\...`
- **Fix**: Created sample data generation script and updated to load sample data

#### 02_data_cleaning.ipynb  
- **Issue**: Trying to load from `../data/raw/iri_sales_data.parquet` which didn't exist
- **Fix**: Now loads from generated sample data

#### 03_eda.ipynb
- **Issue**: Trying to load from `../data/processed/iri_sales_data_clean.parquet`
- **Fix**: Now works with generated cleaned sample data

#### 04_feature_engineering.ipynb through 07_visualization.ipynb
- **Issue**: Incomplete import statements, missing `sys.path.append` fixes
- **Fix**: Standardized import patterns

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Sample Data Generation Script
- **File**: `scripts/create_sample_data.py`
- **Purpose**: Generates realistic sample data that matches IRI format
- **Output**: 
  - `data/raw/iri_sales_data.parquet` (100,000 rows, 36 columns)
  - `data/processed/iri_sales_data_clean.parquet` (100,000 rows, 38 columns)
  - Updated `data/processed/cleaning_summary.json`

### 2. Sample Data Characteristics
- **Products**: 10 Thai Union seafood products with realistic names and UPCs
- **Geographies**: 21 major US markets (Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, etc.)
- **Time Range**: Weekly data from 2022-01-02 to 2025-06-08 (180 weeks)
- **Price Range**: $0.89 to $17.82 (realistic for seafood products)
- **Elasticity**: Built-in price-quantity relationships with elasticity around -1.2
- **Missing Values**: Realistic patterns of missing promotional and historical data

### 3. Data Validation
- All key columns present: quantity_sold, unit_price, revenue, volume, etc.
- Proper date parsing from IRI "Week Ending MM-DD-YY" format
- Business logic validation (price × quantity = revenue relationships)
- Realistic outlier patterns and missing value distributions

## How to Use Fixed Notebooks

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages pandas numpy pyarrow matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn PyYAML
```

### 2. Generate Sample Data (if not already done)
```bash
python3 scripts/create_sample_data.py
```

### 3. Run Notebooks in Order
1. `01_data_loading.ipynb` - Loads and inspects sample data
2. `02_data_cleaning.ipynb` - Cleans data and handles missing values  
3. `03_eda.ipynb` - Exploratory data analysis
4. `04_feature_engineering.ipynb` - Creates features for modeling
5. `05_modeling.ipynb` - Builds price elasticity models
6. `06_evaluation.ipynb` - Evaluates model performance
7. `07_visualization.ipynb` - Creates business visualizations

## Validation Results

✅ **Data Files Created**:
- Raw data: 23.2 MB parquet file with 100,000 records
- Cleaned data: 23.4 MB parquet file with proper column names
- Cleaning summary: Updated JSON with processing statistics

✅ **Import Paths Fixed**:
- All notebooks can now import from `src.utils.*` modules
- Relative paths work correctly from notebooks/ directory
- No more Windows-specific path issues

✅ **Data Structure Validated**:
- Column names match expectations in helper functions
- Date parsing works correctly for IRI format
- Business metrics (price, quantity, revenue) have realistic ranges
- Missing value patterns match real-world data scenarios

## Next Steps

All notebooks should now run without import errors. The sample data provides a complete, realistic dataset for:
- Price elasticity analysis
- Promotional impact assessment  
- Geographic market analysis
- Temporal trend analysis
- Product performance comparison

The generated data maintains the statistical characteristics needed for meaningful elasticity modeling while being completely self-contained for the Linux environment.
